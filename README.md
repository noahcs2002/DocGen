# DocGen

DocGen is designed to be a light-weight documentation generation tool. This idea came about when I was having to document all of my REST API's endpoints in a really tedious way, 
and wanted to come up with a tool to do this for me and any projects in the future.

## Stack
The whole tool will be built using Java. It will primarily be a command-line tool, but I might considering making a React-app GUI for it.
